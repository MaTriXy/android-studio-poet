# Extending AS Poet

AS Poet is designed to be extendable. When you want to add a new feature you should follow up the following three steps, each step shouldn't take you more than 30 minutes to grasp. In this doc let's extend AS Poet with my ```cool feature```. All in all, you will need to modify/create three key files: one JSON and two Kotlin classes (possibly more, but these are the key ones that define the architecture).

## 1. Add your feature to the JSON config
At the highest level, think of AS Poet as of a function that accept a JSON configuration file that mimics your project and outputs an Android Studio buildable project(folders and files) based on the JSON config.

### AS Poet has 2 JSON config formats
1. [Compact format](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/ConfigCompact.json) - the the minimal set of configurations to get started or create projects without fine module control.

2. [Full format](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/ConfigFull.json) - full configuration control over created modules, that gives you the ability to control every module separately in terms of dependencies, method count and class count.

We recommend adding features to the full format, as it requires less work and keeps the compact json simple. 

You start by updating the JSON model to support your new JSON fields. The [input](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/input) folder holds all the JSON to objects mappings classes.
Root class for the full format is [`GenerationConfig`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/input/GenerationConfig.kt). Please note, that Gson object is created in the class [`Injector`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/Injector.kt), there you can customize it. Read the code sample below (taken from [`ConfigFull`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/ConfigFull.json)):

``` json
    "moduleName": "applicationModule",
    "activityCount": 5,
    "myCoolFeature": "myCoolFeatureValue",
    "hasLaunchActivity": true,
```

If you want to extend the compact format, the you need to write/modify a [`converter`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/converters) from compact format to full, since generators (you see them in a minute) understand only the full format models.

## 2. Create/update blueprint

Blueprints are data classes that hold all the information needed to create Android project artifacts. Blueprints handle the "business" logic. That architecture allows the following benefits:

1. Dependencies resolution between the projects (one of the complicated features) without the actual code generation
2. Separation of concerns, keeping the blueprints easy to grasp

Here the blueprints you must absolutely know:
* [`PackageBlueprint`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/models/PackageBlueprint.kt)
* [`ModuleBlueprint`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/models/ModuleBlueprint.kt)
* [`AndroidModuleBlueprint`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/models/AndroidModuleBlueprint.kt)

Start by looking at the above classes, thenfind the places you want to modify or add a new blueprint. Prefer to add a new one to keep the blueprints small.

For example, [`ModuleBuildGradleBlueprint`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/models/ModuleBuildGradleBlueprint.kt) is used to describe the  `build.gradle` file of a `java-library` module: 

* As an input, the blueprint takes a list of dependencies and different flags (some blueprints take directly input objects)
* The blueprint creates sets of plugins and libraries that should be applied/included into resulted `build.gradle` file (defined by the input flags)
* In addition, the blueprint is responsible for calculating path to the new file

## 3. Create/update generator

Generator is the layer that takes a blueprint and writes down its representation as a file on disk. 

For example [`ModuleBuildGradleGenerator`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/generators/ModuleBuildGradleGenerator.kt):

* The generator takes [`ModuleBuildGradleBlueprint`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/models/ModuleBuildGradleBlueprint.kt) described in the previous section
* The generator applies [`GradleLang`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/gradle/GradleLang.kt) to generate Gradle statements
* Each statement can display itself as a part of Gradle script
* The generator saves result into the file

### Technical details to keep in mind:
* All interactions with the file system should be done via [`FileWriter`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/writers/FileWriter.kt).
* Java code is generated with [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet).
* Gradle Scripts are generated with simplified language that you can find in [`GradleLang`](https://github.com/android/android-studio-poet/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/google/androidstudiopoet/gradle/GradleLang.kt), feel free to extend it.
* Feel free to add [KotlinPoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet).
* We are currently in the process of choosing "Poet" for XML files, you are welcome to propose one
